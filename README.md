# GovTech campus event support process "submit forms"

During the workshop phase at the GovTech Campus event on 2024-02-07 in Berlin, participates will be able to submit the forms they've created.
This repository is a OZG-Hub process that can be used to submit and retrieve those forms.

The process is supposed to be available at https://dev.behoerden-serviceportal.de/onlineantraege/onlineantrag?prozessKey=m102.govTecEventSubmitForm.
The submitted forms are sent to the 'testUserPST' user on the integration system of bund.id.
